# Params from executor for kube-up.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# KUBE_UP_MODE defines how to run kube-up, there are currently three modes:
#
# - "tarball": In tarball mode, kube binaries and non-kube binaries are built
#   as a single tarball. There are two different behaviors in tarball mode:
#   - If BUILD_TARBALL is N, we build current code base and push to remote host,
#     using script hack/caicloud/build-tarball.sh.
#   - If BUILD_TARBALL is Y, then we simply fetch from remote host.
#
# - "image": In image mode, we use pre-built custom image. It is assumed that
#   the custom image has all binaries and packages installed, i.e. kube binaries,
#   non-kube binaries, docker, bridge-utils, etc. Image mode is the fastest mode,
#   but requires we pre-built the image and requires the image is accessible for
#   all sub account. This is currently not possible in anchnet, since every sub
#   account can only see its own custom image.
#
# - "dev": In dev mode, no machine will be created. Developer is responsible to
#   specify the master instance ID and node instance IDs. This is primarily used
#   for debugging kube-up.sh script itself to avoid repeatly creating resources.
